# Uncle Bob at SkillsMatter talks about Design Patterns



This week is incredibly busy for me as I am going to a meetup every day but it started with a great talk by Uncle Bob (Robert C. Martin) about Design Patterns at SkillsMatter. In it he gives what appeared to be a completely unrehearsed a run through of some of the design patterns volunteered by the audience.

It's rare that you get such great speakers with such experience, rarer still when the event is free and I feel very lucky to have been able to be there.

If you didn't make it and want the next best thing you can [watch it online](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/design-architecture/in-the-brain-of-uncle-bob)... There's other videos of Uncle Bob too, which I'm looking forward to watching very soon.
