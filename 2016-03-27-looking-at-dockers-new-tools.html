<h4>Linux users have very easy native Docker</h4>
<p>Being a Linux user I always had native <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> access. Once I had installed Docker and added my user to the Docker group <code>docker build</code> etc would always just work. What's more the integration with networks etc is fantastic. I was happy.</p>
<h4>The reason for looking...</h4>
<p>Currently at work we have some really big data import jobs to run, some take over a day to run and I was been given the job of planning and running these.</p>
<p>I created a range of scripts to do this job as it requires multiple steps. It is all documented but is not yet at the stage of having a single push button installation. The imported data finally becomes what is in effect a read only database and is potentially updated monthly making the need for push button installation more pressing. The pain of developers not having correct / sufficient test data is also quite pressing.</p>
<p>On the initial load of the data I span up a single EC2 server and ran the scripts on there, which worked fine but this has two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's a pain to replicate this every month, each individual step is quite well tested but the process as a whole is quite manual, therefore error prone.</li>
<li>I need something which is runnable by my <a href="http://www.apple.com/uk/mac">Mac</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windows">Windows</a> running collegues.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Perhaps Docker can help me do the load?</h4>
<p>My idea is to run <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-machine">Docker Machine</a> to achieve this as it will give me an easy way to provision, run and destroy the physical hardware on EC2 and provides the necessary abstraction to help my collegues with their architecturally challenged operating systems.</p>
<h4>Docker Locally in a VirtualBox VM</h4>
<p>Installing was super easy, I just followed the instructions at (the installation page)[<a href="https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/">https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/</a>], unsurprisingly I had to run them as <code>root</code> as they write files to <code>/usr/local/bin</code> but then:</p>
<pre><code>fozz@cobol:~/Projects/docker-tech $ docker-machine version
docker-machine version 0.6.0, build e27fb87
</code></pre>
<p>Docker machine seems that it is installed correctly. I didn't bother with the bash completion scripts as I was yet to be sold on this method.</p>
<p>It tells me that I can list machines using:</p>
<pre><code>fozz@cobol:~/Projects/docker-tech $ docker-machine ls
NAME   ACTIVE   DRIVER   STATE   URL   SWARM   DOCKER   ERRORS
</code></pre>
<p>And I can create machines with VirtualBox driver by:</p>
<pre><code>fozz@cobol:~/Projects/docker-tech $ docker-machine create -d virtualbox bob
Running pre-create checks...
(bob) You are using version 4.3.34r104062 of VirtualBox. If you encounter issues, you might want to upgrade to version 5 at https://www.virtualbox.org
Creating machine...
(bob) Copying /home/fozz/.docker/machine/cache/boot2docker.iso to /home/fozz/.docker/machine/machines/bob/boot2docker.iso...
(bob) Creating VirtualBox VM...
(bob) Creating SSH key...
...
</code></pre>
<p>Interestingly the machine name <code>bob</code> is also the machine name given to it in VirtualBox, nice.</p>
<p><img src="/content-assets/2016-03-27-looking-at-dockers-new-tools/vb-screenshot.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It also shows up in <code>docker-machine ls</code> correctly.</p>
<pre><code>fozz@cobol:~/Projects/docker-tech $ docker-machine ls
NAME   ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                         SWARM   DOCKER    ERRORS
bob    -        virtualbox   Running   tcp://192.168.99.100:2376           v1.10.3
</code></pre>
<p>Running the below command switches all the docker commands to run the virtual machine.</p>
<pre><code>fozz@cobol:~/Projects/docker-tech $ eval "$(docker-machine env bob)"

fozz@cobol:~/Projects/docker-tech $ docker run busybox echo hello world

Status: Downloaded newer image for busybox:latest
hello world
</code></pre>
<p>This environment change happens only in the current terminal. So this raises the prospect of a developer using one virtual machine per project, with many docker images running within it. Very nice.</p>
<h4>Taking it to AWS</h4>
<p>All the above is <strong>really</strong> great, it looks like it will solve the problem of differnet OS's needed to provision local databases for testing/development purposes. But what about putting it all live into AWS.</p>
<p>Well I have the AWS CLI tools already set up, so I can do things like:</p>
<pre><code>aws s3 cp my-file.png s3://bucket-name/my-file.png
</code></pre>
<p>without having to specify anything. These AWS CLI tools are one of the best things about AWS in my opinion, there's so much there. Anyway this is all set up easily using the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html">official instructions</a>. By the way I really recommend going with the <code>AWS_PROFILE</code> environmental variable route or at least using the <code>~/.aws/credentials</code> and <code>~/.aws/config</code> files.</p>
<p>So I thought perhaps all I would need to do is <code>export AWS_PROFILE='my-profile'</code> and combine that with the <code>--driver amazonec2</code> flag but alas:</p>
<pre><code>fozz@cobol:~/Projects/docker-tech $  docker-machine create --driver amazonec2 aws-dm
Running pre-create checks...
Error with pre-create check: "unable to find a subnet in the zone: us-east-1a"
</code></pre>
<h4>Needing to be more explicit for AWS...</h4>
<p>Unfortunately getting the whole thing working wasn't quite as easy as I would have liked it involved:</p>
<pre><code>fozz@cobol:~/Projects/docker-tech $ aws --region us-east-1 ec2 describe-vpcs
{
    "Vpcs": [
        {
            "VpcId": "vpc-2b2ffe4e",
            "InstanceTenancy": "default",
            "State": "available",
            "DhcpOptionsId": "dopt-9d4e5eff",
            "CidrBlock": "172.31.0.0/16",
            "IsDefault": true
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Specifying a VPC</p>
<pre><code>fozz@cobol:~/Projects/docker-tech $ docker-machine create -d amazonec2  --amazonec2-vpc-id vpc-2b2ffe4e  ec2dm
Running pre-create checks...
Error with pre-create check: "unable to find a subnet in the zone: us-east-1a"
</code></pre>

{
    "Subnets": [
        {...}, {...}, {...},
        {
            "VpcId": "vpc-2b2ffe4e",
            "CidrBlock": "172.31.32.0/20",
            "MapPublicIpOnLaunch": true,
            "DefaultForAz": true,
            "State": "available",
            "AvailabilityZone": "us-east-1b",
            "SubnetId": "subnet-5455657c",
            "AvailableIpAddressCount": 4091
        }
    ]
}

fozz@cobol:~ $ docker-machine create -d amazonec2  --amazonec2-vpc-id vpc-2b2ffe4e --amazonec2-subnet-id subnet-5455657c  ec2dm

<p>But after that it showed up:</p>

</code></pre>
<h4>It works</h4>
<p>And I went about testing it:</p>
<pre><code>fozz@cobol:~ $ eval $(docker-machine env ec2dm)

fozz@cobol:~ $ docker ps

<h4>But does it work like a local Docker?</h4>
<p>I am wondering initially whether files etc can be used as simply through the EC2 instance as locally.</p>

<h4>Easy Cleanup</h4>
<p>Destroying the resources when no longer needed is also easy:</p>
<pre><code>fozz@cobol:~ $ docker-machine rm ec2dm
About to remove ec2dm
Are you sure? (y/n): y
Successfully removed ec2dm
</code></pre>
<p>Lastly I need to remove the security group Docker Machine created:</p>
<pre><code>fozz@cobol:~ $ aws --region us-east-1 ec2 delete-security-group --group-name docker-machine
</code></pre>
<p>Looks like a plan for running batch import jobs. Wonder where this will take me, I think I'm going to start reading more about <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-swarm">Docker Swarm</a> and <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-registry">Docker Registry</a>.</p>
