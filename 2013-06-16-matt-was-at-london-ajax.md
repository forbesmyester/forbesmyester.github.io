# Matt was at London AJAX



Last Tuesday I presented SyncIt to London AJAX. I was surprisingly not that nervous going in, thanks to all the practice, but I feel I was no less nervous throughout the presentation either.

You can see the presentation at the [skillsmatter](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/syncit-solving-offline-for-apps) site, who are the really nice people who host London AJAX.
