# CSV Guillotine - First Rust Program / Library


I have just published my first rust program, first rust library and crates.io package.

It's a library/program for removing metadata from above the (real) header of CSV files, which gets in the way when writing software to parse the CSV's

The [Git Repository](https://github.com/forbesmyester/csv-guillotine) includes full source code as well as examples how to use the program, or the library.
