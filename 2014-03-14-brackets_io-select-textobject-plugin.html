<p>I am currently (and have been for a long time) in a state of flux with my current editor selection... For a while about 6 months ago I thought I would end up using VIM and even started reading a book about it. I learnt about VIM Golf, the amazing "." command, Tim Pope's awesome Surround...</p>
<p>I've learnt a lot about VIM but somewhere along the line it beeped at me one too many times and I felt compelled to go to something a bit more modern. I am currently trying out <a href="http://brackets.io/">Adobe's Brackets.io</a> which has some neet features and even has a form of a Surround plugin which will surround your currently selected text, but the missing out is how to getting that selection.</p>
<p>What was needed was a way to quickly and easily easily select text... it needed VIM's select-textobject function... So I created it!!! (or at least something similar)</p>
<p>If you don't know VIM text objects,Here's an example of what it can do Bold itels are selections.</p>
<p>Suppose I have the following input:</p>
<p>I have some <span>Text (that I want t **\|** o select)</span> here</p>
<p>I could use "<code>iw</code>" for inner word:</p>
<p>I have some <span>Text (that I want **to** select)</span> here</p>
<p>I could use "<code>i(</code>" for inside a bracketted area:</p>
<p>I have some **<span>Text (that I want to select)</span>** here</p>
<p>I could use "<code>it</code>" for inside a tag:</p>
<p>I have some <span> **Text (that I want to select)** </span> here</p>
<p>I could use "<code>at</code>" for a tag:</p>
<p>I have some **<span>Text (that I want to select)</span>** here</p>
<p>I could use "<code>a&#x3C;p</code>" to select the the "<code>&#x3C;p></code>" tag:</p>
<p> **I have some <span>Text (that I want to select)</span> here** </p>
<p>Which is of course identical in this case to "<code>i2t</code>" and "<code>2t</code>":</p>
<p> **I have some <span>Text (that I want to select)</span> here** </p>
<p>If you have Brackets.io installed you can go to <em>File > Extension Manager</em> and search for "select text object" and it will come up. You can also get the source, as always <a href="https://github.com/forbesmyester/js.forbesmyester.select-textobject">at GitHub</a>. It goes really well with the "Brackets Surround" and "Brackets Key Remapper" plugins.</p>
