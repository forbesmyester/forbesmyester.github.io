Today I disovered a great little tool for helping to draw small flow diagrams and then being able to export them into ASCII! It does not try to be a complicated tool, but instead gives you simple very simple ones just for drawing boxes lines, writing text and moving that text around. It's not going to be useful for drawing overall system diagrams but for when you want to document how a particular function works and be able to embed that diagram directly into the code for something like [PHPDoc](http://www.phpdoc.org/), [Javadoc](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-jsp-135444.html) or [Docker](http://jbt.github.io/docker/src/docker.js.html) it's wonderful.
