<p>I recently re-installed <strong>my laptop</strong> (which <strong>has loopback, WIFI and wired network connections</strong>) from scratch and I found that it has <strong>"NetworkManager is not running"</strong> displayed when I click the NetworkManager applet, which is <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/572003/network-manager-no-longer-starts-automatically/572007#572007">apparently</a> <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/429207/network-manager-not-running">not</a> <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2009719">that</a> <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1706208">strange</a>. This was straight after an install which was disappointing :-(</p>
<p>My installation method for my laptop comes from an <strong>Ubuntu 14.04 Server</strong> base with some desktop components. The reason for this is that I have switched to OpenBox which is lovely compared to Unity and I don't run into the bugs I always do when customising XFCE... it's also lightning fast. Unfortunately sometimes because of this it's a bit difficult to google for answers...</p>
<p>If I installed the desktop version of Ubuntu I believe it will let you use the the WIFI when installing (which is very nice) however when you install the server edition there is no prompt for wifi and I ended up <strong>plugging in a cable for the installation</strong>, this left my <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> looking like the following:</p>
<pre><code># This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
</code></pre>
<p>Which is pretty reasonable and correct... however this configuration causes NetworkManager to not start, or at least be disabled... You need to remove all the lines which reference <code>eth0</code> and then NetworkManager will start properly!</p>
<p>Pretty surprised at this, as I have three network devices. Surely I've just gone down from 2 network devices being managed by <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> to one, so I don't understand why NetworkManager would refuse to start and manage my WIFI in both cases...</p>
