<p>Hacky tools for PostgreSQL that makes interacting / extracting / analysis of data in PostgreSQL easier.</p>
<p><img src="/content-assets/screenshot.png" alt="screenshot"></p>
<p>NOTE: Examples are from a PostgreSQL version of <a href="https://ergast.com/mrd/">ergast</a>.</p>
<h4>psql-out</h4>
<p>Sometimes I find I have requests like the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run this query and give me the results [in an Excel file so I can look at them in Excel].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also sometimes I want to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Run a complicated query and get the results as <a href="http://ndjson.org/">ndjson</a> so I can process them in JavaScript.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But sometimes I'm:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looking at data trying to figure out if a hypothesis makes sense and want to throw things into graphs very, very quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not cool, it's not pretty, but this is what <code>psql-out</code> is for!</p>
<p>If you've got your environmental variables set up (see <code>pgpass-env</code> lower down) you can do something like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">echo 'select name, position from competitors' | psql-out
</code></pre>
<p>And get a well formed CSV file out into STDOUT.</p>
<p>To write it to a file you just need to add <code>> your_file.csv</code> to the end to pipe STDOUT to the desired file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">echo 'select name, position from competitors' | psql-out > your_file.csv
</code></pre>
<p>If you want it as an ndjson file you can run</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">echo 'select name, position from competitors' | psql-out -f ndjson
</code></pre>
<p>To get an ndjson file out. You can also get a TSV (Tab seperated CSV) out by passing <code>-t tsv</code>.</p>
<h4>termgraph-runner</h4>
<p>When you've got your nice CSV using the tools from above and you want to see if the data looks correct quickly one of the best ways I know to do this is to draw a quick graph. You could fire up Excel or <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> and pointy-clicky to get your graph. This is a <strong>really</strong> bad solution if you're still finding out whether your data is correct because that feedback loop of command-line -> csv -> spreadsheet > graph is pretty long. What if you could quickly draw graphs right in your terminal... You can using termgraph-runner (which is backed by the awesome <a href="https://github.com/mkaz/termgraph">termgraph</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">
echo '
    select
        code,
        sum(CASE WHEN position = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as win,
        sum(CASE WHEN position &#x3C;= 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as podium
    from results
    natural join drivers
    group by code
    order by 2 desc limit 5' | psql-out -f csv | termgraph-runner --stacked

</code></pre>
<h4>pgpass-env</h4>
<p>I found that I have files that look like the following in the root of most of my source code repositories (and in my <code>.gitignore</code> of course):</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">export PGHOST="127.0.0.1"
export PGDATABASE="my_product"
export PGUSER="my_product"
export PGPASSWORD="a_good_password"
export PGPORT="5432"
export LISTEN_PORT="4040"
</code></pre>
<p>However for my database administration GUI I also have a <code>~/.pgpass</code> file in my home directory with the following:</p>
<pre><code>127.0.0.1:5432:my_product:my_product:a_good_password
</code></pre>
<p>This is a duplication of data and is kinda ridiculous.</p>
<p>Enter <code>pgpass-env</code> which is a simple bash script that converts the former into the latter</p>
<p>The idea is to store a name above the lines in the ~/.pgpass like the following</p>
<pre><code># local_my_product
127.0.0.1:5432:my_product:my_product:a_good_password
# local_another_product
127.0.0.1:5432:another_product:another_product:a_good_password
</code></pre>
<p>Running just <code>pgpass-env</code> it gives you a list of possible options:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ pgpass-env
Pass one of the following
    * local_my_product
    * local_another_product
</code></pre>
<p>But if you would pass the name of a connection it would output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ . pgpass-env local_my_product
> postgres://my_product@127.0.0.1:5432/my_product
</code></pre>
<p>While at the same time performing the required <code>EXPORT PGUSER=my_product</code> etc. Using the preceding <code>.</code> means those environmental variables will be brought into the current environment, which is probably what you want.</p>
<p>It also adds adds <code>$DATABASE_URL</code> which I use in <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-dadbod">vim-dadbod</a> but I also understand is used by Heroku.</p>
<p>NOTE: Look at the BASH source code, <code>pgpass-env</code> is quick, simple code to get the job done, <strong>not</strong> perfect code. You can see that the .pgpass fields are separated by <code>:</code> but I have put no thought in how to escape a <code>:</code> should one be included in a password. If your password includes a <code>:</code> it'll probably break.</p>
<h4>Installation</h4>
<p>Installation is simple with some BASH tomfoolery:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">mkdir -p ~/.local/bin &#x26;&#x26; find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -executable | parallel ln -s "$PWD/{/}" ~/.local/bin
</code></pre>
<h4>Other interesting tools I've found to do portions of this...</h4>
<p>I've not found anything that I can use to draw pie charts simply in the terminal - ideas welcome.</p>
<h5>Software</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mcastorina/graph-cli">graph-cli</a> Can accept input from STDIN and will pop up your graph in a window.</li>
<li><a href="https://veusz.github.io/">Veusz</a> Is a desktop app which looks like a mix of Tableau and a DTP application. It's file format is plain text and it even has a Python API. It should be possible to wrap this and spit out a great image file.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dkogan/feedgnuplot">feedgnuplot</a> looks like the thing I'd use if I wanted to draw a line graph. Because it's based on gnuplot it can draw your line graph right in the terminal or can popup a window.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Libraries</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2">ggplot</a> is an R library for drawing graphs, could probably whip something up again to output an image file.</li>
<li><a href="https://vega.github.io/">vega</a> and vega-lite are by far the best JavaScript graphing libraries I've ever come across. You can specify a graph using just json and they have a <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/usage/#cli">CLI interface</a> that can spit out png's etc.</li>
</ul>
