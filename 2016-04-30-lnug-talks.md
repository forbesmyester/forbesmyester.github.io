# LNUG Talks



I recently [did a talk at LNUG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPCF4JUyllc) about [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org) and how using diagrams can really help you explain your ideas to other people. I know it is cliched but pictures (diagrams) really do say a thousand words.

[LNUG](http://lnug.org) stands for London [Node](http://nodejs.org) User Group and as such mostly everything covered was Javascript related. There was the [cross compilation of GraphViz by mdaines](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js/) as well as my abstraction on top of this in [DB DiaYAML](https://github.com/forbesmyester/db-diayaml). Outside of these two projects which have the purpose of drawing diagrams I covered briefly two other projects I have created. These are [SyncIt](https://github.com/forbesmyester/SyncIt), where GraphViz was used to draw diagrams during unit tests to ease debugging and [NWQ](https://github.com/forbesmyester/nwq) which is a library for creating worker queues which [can be used with a visualization module](https://github.com/forbesmyester/add-dot-diagram) to see data flowing through it in real time.

This was my second [LNUG](http://lnug.org/) talk, my first talk is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm_OoWabMPk).
