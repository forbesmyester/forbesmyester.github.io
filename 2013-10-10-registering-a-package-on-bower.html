<p>Up until now I have only wanted to use me_map_reduce in <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, but today I wanted to use that functionality on a website too.</p>
<p>This proved to be a very easy exercise even though I have not done it before or even done any of the individual steps!</p>
<p>The instructions given on <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower.io</a> tell me that:</p>
<ul>
<li>There must be a valid manifest JSON in the current working directory.</li>
<li>Your package should use semver Git tags.</li>
<li>Your package must be available at a Git endpoint (e.g., GitHub); remember to push your Git tags!</li>
</ul>
<h4>There must be a valid manifest JSON in the current working directory.</h4>
<p>Starting right at the start, what is a <strong>manifest file</strong>... I try hitting <code>ctrl-f</code> on the page and search for the word 'manifest' but that is the only reference. Doing some <a href="http://www.google.com">Googling</a> I found <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18477306/what-is-the-recommended-manifest-json-format-for-bower-packages">an article on StackOverflow</a> where the recommended answer tells that that I need a <code>bower.json</code> file or a <code>component.json</code> file and "Keep using <code>bower init</code>, it'll do the right thing for you!". Searching on the page reveals that there is a section called "Defining a Package" referencing <code>bower.json</code> and that Some of the Bower components I have installed already have a <code>bower.json</code>. It seems that <code>bower.json</code> <strong>is</strong> the manifest file, makes sense but it always pays to be sure.</p>
<p>Running <code>bower init</code> guides me through the following wizard:</p>
<pre><code>$ bower init
[?] name: me_map_reduce
[?] version: 0.9.0
[?] description: MongoDB style Map/Reduce functionality for JS
[?] main file: lib/me_map_reduce.js
[?] keywords: map, reduce, map/reduce
[?] authors: Matthew Forrester &#x3C;matt@keyboardwritescode.com>
[?] license: BSD-style
[?] homepage: https://github.com/forbesmyester/me_map_reduce
[?] set currently installed components as dependencies? Yes
[?] add commonly ignored files to ignore list? Yes
[?] would you like to mark this package as private which prevents it from being accidentally publis[?] would you like to mark this package as private which prevents it from being accidentally published to the registry? No
</code></pre>
<p>Pretty handy!</p>
<h4>Your package should use semver Git tags.</h4>
<p><a href="http://semver.org/">A page describing Semver</a> is helpfully hyperlinked from the Bower.io homepage and it seems to just be in the form <code>[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]</code>. I elect to use version <code>0.9.0</code> because I cannot see myself ever added extra features to <a href="https://github.com/forbesmyester/me_map_reduce">me_map_reduce</a> but the code has probably got near zero use, so could have bugs and I'd not like to call potentially buggy code version 1.0.0.</p>
<p>How to create a Git Tag is referenced in the (Git Book)[<a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging">http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging</a>] and is pretty easy. The example gives the command <code>git tag -a v1.4 -m 'my version 1.4</code> to create a tag, but that raises another question, does a semver tag include a 'v'... <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16542000/can-i-manage-bower-versioning-via-git-tags-only#comment26621340_16560493">StackOverflow gives an answer</a> which says they do not. So I commit my new <code>bower.json</code> (created by <code>bower init</code>) and then create the tag using the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ git tag -a 0.9.0 -m 'Version 0.9.0'
</code></pre>
<h4>Your package must be available at a Git endpoint (e.g., GitHub); remember to push your Git tags!</h4>
<p>I need to push my tag...</p>
<p>The <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging">Git Book</a> tells me that to push a tag all I need to do is <code>git push origin [tagname]</code> or <code>git push --tags</code> to push all tags... I elect to push all my tags as it's first Tag I have ever created:</p>
<pre><code>git push --tags
</code></pre>
<h4>All Set - Time To Publish!</h4>
<p>Jumping back to <a href="http://bower.io/#registering-packages">the Bower.io registering packages section</a> it says that <code>bower register &#x3C;my-package-name> &#x3C;git-endpoint></code> will register my package. So...</p>
<pre><code>$ bower register me_map_reduce git@github.com:forbesmyester/me_map_reduce.git
</code></pre>
<p>Testing my Bower package using <code>bower install --save me_map_reduce</code> where I wanted to use the code installed me_map_reduce perfectly.</p>
