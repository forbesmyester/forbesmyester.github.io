# Reusable Releases



I am intending to take the [React demonstration](http://todomvc.com/labs/architecture-examples/react/) from [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) and use it as a basis for demonstrating SyncIt. To enable me to do this I have released two seperate pieces of code, which for contractual reasons were always integrated directly into SyncIt and are now available seperately via GitHub and Bower. These are:

- [getTLIdEncoderDecoder](https://github.com/forbesmyester/getTLIdEncoderDecoder) which is a way to generate "Locally unique, shorter, sortable timestamp based Id's".
- [Manip](https://github.com/forbesmyester/manip) which is a way to manipulate nested data in a way reminiscent of MongoDB's "Update Operators" work (eg. `$set`, `$unset`, `$push` and `$inc`)".
