<h4>Why</h4>
<p>When I saw the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1461411552/elite-dangerous">Elite Kickstarter</a> I knew about the old Elite games which I never played but I knew had an amazing reputation. I looked around the page watched some video's and decided to back it. Since then I have read all the news releases and watched all the video's Frontier have put out and I'm really getting quite excited by now!</p>
<p>Due to my pledge level I should be able to play the beta however because I am a Linux user I am probably going to have to wait a bit longer than most to be able to play it :-( For the time being I have decided to download one of the older Elite games to see what all the fuss was about.</p>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<p>This page documents the process of getting glFrontier Elite 2 working on a modern Ubuntu 14.04 system, I expect that this process is what will also work for Mac's however I am guessing it's a bit tougher to get the development libraries etc installed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the required development libraries with <code>apt-get install build-essential libvorbis-dev</code></li>
<li>Download "source code (OpenGL, SD:: unix, mingw)" from <a href="http://tom.noflag.org.uk/glfrontier.html">http://tom.noflag.org.uk/glfrontier.html</a></li>
<li>Extract it with <code>tar -jxf frontvm2-20060623.tar.bz2</code></li>
<li>Enter the newly extracted directory</li>
<li>Type <code>make -f Makefile-C</code> to compile the code, it does print out quite a few warnings, but did work (at least for me)</li>
<li>At this point typing <code>./frontier</code> should launch the game, though it won't yet have any sound and will print lots of warnings about those missing sound files, so...</li>
<li>We now need to download and install the sound files, these are hosted on the same <a href="http://tom.noflag.org.uk/glfrontier.html">http://tom.noflag.org.uk/glfrontier.html</a> page under thane mame "Sound effects and music (optional with the above). Download it.</li>
<li>While still in the extracted game directory untar the sound file, for me it was <code>tar -jxf ../frontvm-audio-20060222.tar.bz2</code> which rather annoyingly created a sub directory, so I had to <code>mv frontvm-audio-20060222/* .; rm -rf frontvm-audio-20060222</code> to clean that up.</li>
<li>Type <code>./frontier</code> and you have a fully working version of Frontier Elite 2!</li>
</ol>
