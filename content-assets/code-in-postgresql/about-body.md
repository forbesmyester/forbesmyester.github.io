### The reason why SQL is so important

When developing systems we often have a choice of writing code (NodeJS, C#, Python or PHP etc) or SQL. I believe that sometimes the decision to write code is taken without fully evaluating how much of the task could be offloaded to SQL.

In this series of articles I wish to show the huge benefits of using and learning SQL by examining progressively more difficult scenarios with increasing amounts of SQL knowledge. In doing this I hope to illustrate that sometimes large amounts of extra code is written for what SQL can achieve quicker, with less complexity and more readability.

To be more specific, we should try to follow the [rule of least power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_least_power) more often.
