<p>I recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPCF4JUyllc">did a talk at LNUG</a> about <a href="http://www.graphviz.org">GraphViz</a> and how using diagrams can really help you explain your ideas to other people. I know it is cliched but pictures (diagrams) really do say a thousand words.</p>
<p><a href="http://lnug.org">LNUG</a> stands for London <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node</a> User Group and as such mostly everything covered was Javascript related. There was the <a href="https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js/">cross compilation of GraphViz by mdaines</a> as well as my abstraction on top of this in <a href="https://github.com/forbesmyester/db-diayaml">DB DiaYAML</a>. Outside of these two projects which have the purpose of drawing diagrams I covered briefly two other projects I have created. These are <a href="https://github.com/forbesmyester/SyncIt">SyncIt</a>, where GraphViz was used to draw diagrams during unit tests to ease debugging and <a href="https://github.com/forbesmyester/nwq">NWQ</a> which is a library for creating worker queues which <a href="https://github.com/forbesmyester/add-dot-diagram">can be used with a visualization module</a> to see data flowing through it in real time.</p>
<p>This was my second <a href="http://lnug.org/">LNUG</a> talk, my first talk is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm_OoWabMPk">here</a>.</p>
